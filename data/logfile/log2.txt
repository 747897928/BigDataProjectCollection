I ain't like no one you met before
I'm running for the front
When they're all running for the door
And I won't sit down won't back out
You can't ever shut me up
Cause I'm on a mission
And I won't quit now
In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
Because the battle's already been won
I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to show
